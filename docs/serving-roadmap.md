# Serving Roadmap — to the North Star

Revamped 2026-07-17 for execution by non-Fable sessions (Opus-class lead,
Sonnet-class implementers, Haiku-class mechanical). The prior roadmap —
including the full trajectory table, the Arc D correction history, and the
2026-07-09 path items — is frozen verbatim in
`docs/serving-roadmap-archive-2026-07-17.md`; treat it as provenance, not
as the plan. This document is the plan. Its **State** section is rewritten
(not appended) at each update; history lives in the archive and in git.

## North star

**Full model parity through composition** (see `docs/serving.md`): llm-orc
served agentically behind OpenCode should be as functional as Claude Code
running a frontier model, and beyond it where composition wins, all through
orchestrated small models. This is a literal engineering target. The
comparator is a frontier model PLUS its harness — behind OpenCode it reads
files, runs tests, and iterates, so "a model doesn't check its work" is not
the bar. Three levers a monolithic model does not have:

1. **Verified acceptance** — structural verification (an unverified build
   cannot ship) vs the comparator's discretionary verification (it checks
   when it or harness policy chooses).
2. **Lossless memory** — deterministic selection over the full history
   (eventually cross-session substrate) instead of attention over a
   decaying window.
3. **Zero marginal cost** — systematic coverage (more rounds, more
   verification, more retrieval) is free where every frontier token is
   billed.

Latency is the accepted trade. Two axes on top of the levers: **task
generality** (closed intent set today → catalog growth → compose-at-runtime
→ composer ensembles; the ADR-047 ladder, WS-7) and **long-horizon
operation** (the client's agentic loop is the engine; the serve is a
deterministic next-action function over a lossless record; WS-5/6).

Posture (practitioner, 2026-07-11): local-first; occasional hosted
capability in a measured seat when it is the cheapest path to the bar,
every hosted seat carried as a named buy-back target (§Seat-capability
ladder). 32GB rig is the permanent target.

**Development north star (named 2026-07-17).** The serving north star is
an *outcome* — what the endpoint does for a user. Alongside it sits a
*trajectory* target for how the codebase itself evolves: the three-layer
platform (plexus substrate · llm-orc engine · client execution surface,
see `docs/plans/2026-07-17-plexus-integration-platform-assessment.md`)
with layers coupled only through named contracts — MCP tools, the OpenAI
wire + tool_calls, the `{requirement, code, tests}` seat contract, the
client's advertised tool list — never through schemas, file layouts, or
spawn assumptions. Its steering rule: **behavior migrates downward as it
stabilizes** — from prompt rules, to bounded model judgment, to
deterministic code, to the declarative layer (YAML shapes, chain tables,
closed templates), and ultimately, for components that survive
adversarial review and stop changing across arcs, into hardened kernel
code (plausibly Rust crates on the plexus side). Every arc should leave
more behavior in a lower layer than it found it. This is the standing
answer to the rewrite question: no greenfield port; the declarative
layer is the insulation that keeps an eventual hardening cheap, and
"frozen component" status is the trigger, tracked informally the way the
buy-back ledger tracks hosted seats.

## State (2026-08-12)

| arm / serve version | runs | strict | dishonest | record |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Arm 0 pre-fix (v0.18.14) | 2/3/4 | 25/39 | 3 (one per run) | `docs/plans/2026-07-1{4,5}-arm0-runs/` |
| Arm 0 post-fix (main 2026-08-12) | 5 | 11/13 | 0 | `docs/plans/2026-08-12-arm0-run5/` |
| Arm 2a Haiku 4.5 | 1, 2 | 13/13, 11/13 | 0, 2 | `docs/plans/2026-07-15-arm2-runs/`, `2026-08-12-arm2-runs/` |
| Arm 2b Sonnet | 1 | 13/13 | 0 | `docs/plans/2026-07-15-arm2-runs/` |
| Arm 1 (paid) | 0 | — | — | go/no-go pending |

Versions differ across rows; do not pool. Caveats: parity table v1
(`docs/plans/2026-07-15-first-parity-table.md`). Merged-unreleased set
tracked by #146. Operating rules: `docs/loop-protocol.md`.

- [ ] #85 #84 #90 #93 #95 #106 #110 #114 #132 #142 — platform hardening as gates demand
- [ ] North star: parity on real work, honesty column held at zero

## Doctrine (what we learned, made binding)

Rules future sessions follow without re-deriving. Each was paid for with a
measurement; provenance in the archive.

1. **Independent scoring for every judgment-bearing claim.** Author scores
   were systematically optimistic (three runs' "zero dishonest" all
   overturned). Any J-tier score, honesty verdict, or review APPROVE comes
   from a session/agent that did not author the work. Blinding is inert
   (Arm 0's prose is templated); independence plus the frozen rubric is
   the control that works.
2. **Structural lever after two prompt iterations.** Prompt rules saturate
   the 8b seat (measured twice); when a failure class survives two prompt
   changes, reach for determinism, shape change, or escalation-on-signal —
   never a third rule.
3. **Structure beats model size — but re-measure per era.** Deterministic
   gate repairs took the ladder 4/10 → 7/10 where {8b, 14b} × {think
   on/off} were identical; the 14b test-writer A/B was not a clean win.
   The doctrine goes stale as the structural breakers are removed; the
   seat ladder (#119) exists to re-test it, ≥3 runs per seat.
4. **State the invariant, not the instance.** In five review rounds,
   everything mechanically checkable held; everything patched
   instance-by-instance failed again until stated as an invariant (the
   dead-turn rule, the equality-pins-representation bug fixed in one
   oracle and left live in the next).
5. **No self-confirming metrics.** The verification-rate metric is
   WITHDRAWN, not deferred: it read a design constant on Arm 0 and a
   behavior on Arms 1/2. Crediting the serve from its own trace is
   circular. Ground truth is the WORKSPACE, never any transcript.
6. **Per-turn diagnosis is unsupported at current n.** Misses are noise
   around a rate (~5 points ride on turn 1); only aggregate rates are
   estimable. Run 2 falsified the turn-1-cascade claim. #63's statistics
   become relevant as n grows.
7. **The headline is the 2x2, never a raw count.** Raw counts have a
   degenerate optimum at refusing everything — the serve's own failure
   mode. Primary figure: `shipped_broken/shipped`, delivery beside it.
8. **Real-client validation at the earliest runnable point, never
   harness-only.** Hermetic green is necessary, not sufficient; every
   capability arc ends with a live battery row.
9. **Determinism for answers; model judgment only in bounded, low-risk,
   gate-backstopped routing; honesty-critical paths fail closed** (the #82
   two-layer split is the worked example).
10. **Free-first; estimate before paid spend; hosted seats are named IOUs
    in the buy-back ledger.**

## Environments (tag every task)

- **RIG** — the 32GB Ollama rig with OpenCode: live batteries, Arm-0/Arm-1
  runs, seat A/Bs, latency data, plexus (local sibling repo). Ops notes:
  batteries run detached (nohup + disown, Monitor tail); `opencode run`
  wedges under the agent Bash sandbox (see memory `opencode-run-wedge`);
  cooling headroom between batteries.
- **ANY** — any session including remote containers: hermetic TDD against
  the full suite (`uv` + Python 3.11 suffice), design docs, scorer/oracle/
  adapter code, reviews, doc work. RIG-tagged validation of ANY-developed
  work is queued, not skipped: the PR says "needs rig battery" and the next
  rig session runs it.
- **REMOTE** — a remote Claude Code session specifically: **Arm-2 battery
  runs** (subagent model overrides + continuation), GitHub issue hygiene,
  independent J-scoring and reviews (a fresh remote session is naturally
  author-independent).

## Delegation contract (updated for non-Fable sessions)

Every arc: short design doc (`docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-*.md`) → TDD
implementation → live real-OpenCode validation at the earliest runnable
point (RIG; queued explicitly if the implementing session lacks the rig)
→ ladder rerun + a row appended to the archive's trajectory table →
**author-independent adversarial review with an explicit wrong-accept hunt
before merge** (the review record is five-for-five on finding real
blockers the author missed).

Session roles:
- **Lead (Opus-class):** designs, reviews, sequencing decisions, this
  document. On entry: read §State, §Doctrine, and the card being worked —
  not the archive.
- **Implementer (Sonnet-class):** one task card per arc, TDD, hermetic
  suite green, PR notes any queued RIG validation.
- **Mechanical (Haiku-class):** #95-grade sweeps, doc syncs, battery
  bookkeeping, table updates from existing records.
- **Scoring/review independence (doctrine 1):** J-scores and review
  APPROVEs come from a session or agent that did not author the work; a
  fresh remote session is naturally independent. The frozen rubric
  governs; corrections are amended in the rubric, never edited away.

## Standing constraints

- 32GB rig is the permanent target; interactive latency is first-class.
- Local-first defaults; hosted seats are operator opt-in, never tracked
  (`*.local.yaml`), each carried in the buy-back ledger.
- Real-client validation at the earliest runnable point; every capability
  stage lands with its ladder rerun and a trajectory row (archive table).
- Deterministic control; model judgment only inside bounded, closed-set,
  gate-backstopped decisions; honesty-critical paths fail closed.
- Ground truth is the workspace; independent scoring for judgment claims.
