# Parallelization Architecture Design

## Overview
Enhanced EnsembleExecutor with intelligent parallelization, performance monitoring, and streaming capabilities.

## Core Components

### 1. Enhanced EnsembleExecutor
- **Dependency Graph Analysis**: Analyzes agent dependencies to optimize execution order
- **Parallel Execution Engine**: Executes independent agents concurrently
- **Performance Monitoring**: Collects metrics for Issue #27 visualization
- **Streaming Interface**: Provides real-time progress updates

### 2. Connection Pool Manager
- **Per-Provider Pooling**: Shared HTTP clients per API key/provider
- **Context Isolation**: Each model instance maintains separate conversation history
- **Resource Management**: Connection limits and cleanup

### 3. Performance Monitoring System
- **Execution Timeline**: Track start/completion times for each agent
- **Resource Usage**: Memory, CPU, and network metrics
- **Performance Hooks**: Integration points for Issue #27 visualization

## Architecture Flow

```
EnsembleExecutor.execute()
├── Script Agents (Sequential - for now)
├── Dependency Analysis
│   ├── Independent LLM Agents → Parallel Execution
│   └── Dependent LLM Agents → Sequential after dependencies
├── Performance Monitoring (throughout)
└── Synthesis (if configured)
```

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Parallelization Strategy**
- **Script Agents**: Sequential execution (deterministic, often fast)
- **Independent LLM Agents**: Full parallelization using asyncio.gather()
- **Dependent LLM Agents**: Sequential execution after dependencies complete

### 2. **Context Isolation**
- Each ModelInterface instance maintains own conversation history
- Shared HTTP clients are stateless (network layer only)
- No cross-agent context contamination

### 3. **Performance Monitoring Integration**
- Hooks for Issue #27 visualization at key execution points
- Real-time progress updates via async generators
- Comprehensive metrics collection

### 4. **Error Handling**
- Graceful degradation when agents fail
- Ensemble continues with available results
- Detailed error reporting

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 2: Core Parallelization
1. Enhanced dependency graph analysis
2. Optimized parallel execution engine
3. Connection pooling implementation

### Phase 3: Performance Infrastructure
1. Monitoring hooks for Issue #27
2. Streaming execution interface
3. Resource management system

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
1. Comprehensive test suite
2. CLI integration
3. Performance benchmarks

## Success Metrics
- **3x+ Performance**: Parallel execution of independent agents
- **<60s Target**: Complex ensembles under 60 seconds
- **Context Safety**: Zero cross-agent context contamination
- **Resource Efficiency**: Connection pooling reduces API latency
- **Monitoring Ready**: Issue #27 visualization hooks functional
