"""Session Artifact Store — substrate-routing for capability-ensemble deliverables.

Per ``docs/agentic-serving/system-design.agents.md`` §Session Artifact
Store (L1, *new in Cycle 6 per ADR-025*). Owns:

* The ``.llm-orc/agentic-sessions/<session_id>/<dispatch_id>/<deliverable>.<ext>``
  path layout — session-scoped grouping makes session-level review,
  cleanup, and (future) Plexus ingestion natural.
* The ``<session_id>`` format
  (``<iso-8601-datetime>-<short-uuid>`` — chronological filesystem
  sort + same-second disambiguation).
* The typed :class:`ArtifactReference` shape consumers find at
  ``envelope.artifacts[0]`` per ADR-024 + ADR-025.
* Retention semantics enforcement — ``session`` artifacts removed at
  session close; ``durable`` artifacts persist indefinitely;
  ``ephemeral`` artifacts removed at the orchestrator's next turn.

This module is the L1-substrate. It does not depend on Session
Registry — Session Registry calls ``cleanup_session`` at session-close
per the L3 → L1 direction. It does not depend on Orchestrator Tool
Dispatch — Tool Dispatch calls ``write_deliverable`` per the L2 → L1
direction. It does depend on the filesystem and on
:class:`DispatchEventSubstrate` *conceptually* (the ``<dispatch_id>``
segment is the same value the substrate allocates), though the path-
construction code here takes ``dispatch_id`` as a parameter — the
substrate is the single source of truth for the identifier, this
module is a faithful consumer.

Cycle 6 WP-E scope. The substrate-routing pathway in Tool Dispatch
(``invoke_ensemble`` interposition step 8 per system-design.agents.md
§Orchestrator Tool Dispatch Cycle 6 amendment) writes through this
module when the dispatched ensemble's ``output_substrate == "artifact"``.
