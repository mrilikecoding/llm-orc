task: |
  Test the OAuth authentication functionality by having different agents
  with different authentication methods collaborate on a simple task:
  
  1. API agent: Analyze the benefits of OAuth authentication
  2. OAuth agent: Review the analysis and add perspective
  3. Local agent: Summarize the key points
