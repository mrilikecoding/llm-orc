Let me read it again: \"Test task\". The user might be testing my response or expecting me to handle a specific query.\n\nSince the user hasn't provided any specific details or context, I should ask for more information to ensure I'm addressing the correct task. Maybe they want me to explain how to approach a test or ask a question. I need to prompt them to clarify the task so I can provide a useful response. Let me check if there's any ambiguity in the message. No, the task is quite general. I'll ask them to specify the task details so I can assist effectively.\n</think>\n\nCould you please clarify what the specific task you're referring to is? For example, are you asking me to process a test, analyze something, or respond to a question? Let me know how I can assist!",
